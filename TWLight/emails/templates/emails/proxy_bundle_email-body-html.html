  <p>Hi {{ username }},</p>

  <p>The Wikipedia Library is pleased to announce the implementation of EZProxy access and the Library Bundle!</p>

  <p>EZProxy is a proxy server used to authenticate your access. Instead of managing individual logins for each collection to which you have been approved, you can now access all EZProxy-supported content simply by logging in to your Library Card account and clicking through to the website. To access EZProxy collections, simply visit the Library Card platform, go to the My Library page at https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org/users/my_library, and click on ‘Access collection’ for the content you wish to access under the ‘Instant access’ tab.</p>

  <p>If you had active accounts before now, please take the time to review the My Library page to verify how you need to access those accounts going forward. Collections in the 'Instant Access' tab must now be accessed via EZProxy. Collections in the 'Individual Access' tab should be accessed as before.</p>

  <p>Until now, all access via The Wikipedia Library required that you apply to and be approved for individual collections. The Library Bundle changes that workflow by making some collections immediately available to everyone who meets the experience requirements outlined in our Terms of Use. As long as you continue to meet those requirements (which include 10 edits within the past month and not being blocked), you will have on-demand access to Library Bundle collections via the Library Card without needing to make an application or renewal request.</p>

  <p>You can verify whether you meet the criteria to access Library Bundle collections on the Library Card homepage - https://wikipedialibrary.wmflabs.org. If you are eligible, collections will be accessible via the 'Instant Access' tab of My Library.</p>

  <p>You may notice when accessing resources via EZProxy that URLs are dynamically rewritten. Note that use of EZProxy requires you to enable cookies. If you are having problems you should also try clearing your cache and restarting your browser. Please be aware that existing individual logins for EZProxy-enabled collections (including the Library Bundle) will soon be deactivated, so this will be your only means of access for these collections. Any collections in the ‘Individual access’ tab in My Library will function as before.</p>

  <p>Along with the launch of these new access methods, we are happy to announce several major new partnerships, including large multidisciplinary collections from Springer Nature and ProQuest.</p>

  <p>Best,</p>
  <p>The Wikipedia Library Team</p>
